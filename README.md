 **Implementing a Game Leaderboard System with REST API Integration**


**In developing a game leaderboard system, you're provided with the following API endpoints:**

* https://codinginterview.yextengtest.com/api/8371408855101014003/players
* https://codinginterview.yextengtest.com/api/8371408855101014003/games
* https://codinginterview.yextengtest.com/api/8371408855101014003/players/{playerId}/scores

**Explain how you would use these endpoints to create a system that:**
  * Retrieves a list of all players
  * Fetches information about available games
  * Obtains the scores for each player across different games
  * Constructs a leaderboard for a specific game, showing the top 10 players by their highest score
    
**Provide a Java implementation that demonstrates your approach, including how you would handle the API responses, process the data, and display the final leaderboard**
